# m-dev-store
M-Dev Store is a ecommerce created entirely with PHP, Bootstrap and MySQL. It's also used some JQuery for certain tasks. 

The whole project was craeted based on the M-Dev Media YouTube channel tutorial: Creating E-Commerce Website With PHP, MySqli & Bootstrap Tutorial.

# database connection
Instead of using MySQLi API for communicating with the database through PHP, I choosed to use PDO API instead since it supports the communication with other database systems.

# docker-compose
The environment created for the project is created through th following docker-compose commands (also found on the repository).
